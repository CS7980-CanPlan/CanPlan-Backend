# CanPlan 2.0 — Frontend API Reference

_Last updated: 2026-06-22. Version: phase 1 (pre-authorization)._

> ## 🚨 Breaking change — categories, default category, Task status, TaskStep keys
>
> See [Breaking changes — categories & tasks rework](#breaking-changes-categories--tasks-rework)
> for full notes. In short:
>
> - **`Task.status` and the `TaskStatus` enum are removed** (output field + `createTask`/
>   `updateTask` inputs). Tasks no longer have a status.
> - **Real default category.** Every profile now owns one real Category named
>   `No Category` (`isDefault: true`), created with the profile; `Task.categoryId` is now
>   non-null and always a real Category.
> - **Categories are private to their owner.** `createCategory` no longer takes `ownerId`;
>   `listCategoriesByOwner` is replaced by **`listMyCategories`**. New: **`updateCategory`**,
>   **`deleteCategory`**. The owner is always the caller's Cognito identity.
> - **`createTask` no longer takes `ownerId`** (derived from the identity), and a supplied
>   `categoryId` must be a real, owned category.
> - **`TaskStep.description`** added; **`reorderTaskSteps`** mutation added.
>
> An earlier breaking change also replaced the progress model — see
> [Breaking changes — progress & assignment rework](#breaking-changes-progress--assignment-rework).

The backend exposes a single **AWS AppSync GraphQL** endpoint backed by a single
DynamoDB table. This document covers how to connect, the available operations, and
how errors come back.

The schema lives at [graphql/schema.graphql](../graphql/schema.graphql) — it is the
canonical source of truth for exact types and nullability; this doc is its
human-readable companion.

> ## ⚠️ Authorization: Task & Category operations are owner-scoped; the rest are not yet
>
> **Enforced today:** the `SystemAdmin` admin queries; the **identity-scoped** creators
> (`createUserProfile`, `createTask`) and **all category** operations, which derive the
> owner from the caller's Cognito `sub` and ignore any client-supplied owner id; and
> **every Task / TaskStep operation** — `getTask`, `listTaskSteps`, `listTasksByOwner`,
> `listTasksByCategory`, `updateTask`, `deleteTask`, `createTaskStep`, `updateTaskStep`,
> `deleteTaskStep`, `reorderTaskSteps` — which require the caller's `sub` to equal the
> task's (or requested) `ownerId`, returning `NOT_AUTHORIZED` otherwise. There is no
> delegated-role model yet, so this is strict self-ownership.
>
> **Not enforced yet:** profile reads and the assignment / support-link operations still
> let any authenticated caller act on any `id` (read another user's profile, assign a task
> to any `userId`, link any supporter to any primary user). The schema and keys are
> structured to support per-role rules there, but they are **not implemented in this phase**.
>
> **Do not bake "the server lets me, so it's allowed" into the client.** When
> enforcement ships, calls that succeed today will start returning a `NOT_AUTHORIZED`
> error (see [Error handling](#error-handling)). Write the client so an authorization
> denial is a normal, handleable outcome — not an exception. In particular, always
> pass the caller's own id for self-scoped operations (see below); don't rely on the
> server tolerating someone else's id.

---

## Identity & the `userId` field

**Invariant: for any self-scoped operation, the `id` you pass MUST equal your own
Cognito `sub`.** This is not currently enforced — it is load-bearing anyway, because
of how data is keyed and read back:

- A user's profile is stored at the key derived from their Cognito `sub`
  (`USER#<sub>`), and `getUserProfile(userId)` looks it up by **exactly that
  `userId`**. There is no secondary lookup.
- `createUserProfile` does the right thing automatically — it ignores any
  client-supplied id and uses your `sub` from the session (see below). So your
  profile always lands at `USER#<sub>`.
- But the **read** and every other self-scoped write (`getUserProfile`,
  `createAssignment`, `setAssignmentStepCompletion`, `listAssignmentsForUser`,
  `listAssignmentSteps`, …) take a `userId`/`ownerId` **argument**. If you pass
  anything other than your own `sub` there, you will write rows you can never read
  back through your own profile, or read an empty result — silently, with no error.

**Rule of thumb:** decode the `sub` claim from your Cognito ID token once at sign-in
and use it as the `userId`/`ownerId` for everything that is "about me." Treat ids
that come from a list response (e.g. a supporter acting on a primary user) as the
only legitimate source of *someone else's* id.

---

## Connecting

All requests are a single `POST` to the GraphQL URL with a JSON body of
`{ query, variables }`. There is one URL for the whole API — you select the
operation in the query, not the path.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Endpoint** | The `GraphQLApiUrl` printed by `cdk deploy` (e.g. `https://xxxx.appsync-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/graphql`) |
| **Method** | `POST` |
| **Auth (primary)** | Cognito User Pool JWT in the `Authorization` header |
| **Auth (secondary)** | API key in the `x-api-key` header — for `healthCheck` and tooling only |
| **Content-Type** | `application/json` |

> **Which auth do I use?** Frontend clients (mobile app + web portal) authenticate
> users against the Cognito User Pool and send the user's **ID token** (JWT) in the
> `Authorization` header. The API key is an additional mode kept for the
> unauthenticated `healthCheck` probe and proof-of-concept tooling — don't ship it
> as the app's auth. The User Pool id and client id are CloudFormation outputs
> (`UserPoolId`, `UserPoolClientId`); see the README "Authentication" section.

### Required headers

```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: <Cognito ID token (JWT)>
```

---

## Quick start

A minimal `fetch` wrapper the frontend can build on:

```ts
const GRAPHQL_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_GRAPHQL_URL;

async function graphql<T>(query: string, variables: Record<string, unknown>, idToken: string): Promise<T> {
  const res = await fetch(GRAPHQL_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: idToken, // Cognito ID token (JWT)
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables }),
  });

  const body = await res.json();
  // GraphQL returns HTTP 200 even for field errors — check the errors array.
  if (body.errors?.length) {
    throw new Error(body.errors[0].message);
  }
  return body.data;
}
```

---

## Data model (single table)

Every entity lives in one DynamoDB table keyed by a composite `PK`/`SK`, with an
`entityType` discriminator. The frontend never sees `PK`/`SK` — it works with the
GraphQL types below. The key layout (for reference):

| Entity | PK | SK |
|---|---|---|
| UserProfile | `USER#<userId>` | `#PROFILE` |
| SupportLink | `SUPPORTER#<supporterId>` | `USER#<primaryUserId>` |
| Category | `USER#<ownerId>` | `CATEGORY#<categoryId>` |
| Task (template) | `TASK#<taskId>` | `#META` |
| TaskStep | `TASK#<taskId>` | `STEP#<stepId>` (stable id key; `order` is a plain attribute) |
| Assignment | `USER#<userId>` | `ASSIGN#<assignmentId>` |
| AssignmentStep | `USER#<userId>` | `ASSIGN_STEP#<assignmentId>#STEP#<stepId>` |
| MediaAsset | `TASK#<taskId>` | `MEDIA#<assetId>` |

Six GSIs serve the cross-cutting lists: `supporterIndex` (users managed by a
supporter), `primaryUserSupportLinkIndex` (`SupportLink`s by primary user — keyed on
`userId`/`supporterId`, the inverse of `supporterIndex`; sparse to `SupportLink`,
used by `adminDeleteUser`), `orgIndex` (users in an organization), `taskOwnerIndex`
(task templates by owner), `taskCategoryIndex` (tasks within one owner's category —
keyed on a denormalized `<ownerId>#<categoryId>`, newest-first), and `entityTypeIndex`
(every item of one `entityType`, newest-first — backs the SystemAdmin list-all APIs
without a Scan).

`Assignment` and its `AssignmentStep` snapshots share the `USER#<userId>` partition.
`ASSIGN_STEP#…` deliberately does **not** begin with `ASSIGN#` (its 7th character is
`_`, not `#`), so `listAssignmentsForUser`'s `begins_with(SK, 'ASSIGN#')` query never
returns step rows; `listAssignmentSteps` scopes to one assignment's steps and sorts
them by `order`.

`TaskStep`s are keyed by their stable `stepId` (`STEP#<stepId>`), with `order` stored as
a plain attribute — so a step keeps its key when reordered and a whole-task reorder is one
atomic transaction (`reorderTaskSteps`). The `STEP#` rows are not key-sorted by position,
so `listTaskSteps` (and the steps returned by `reorderTaskSteps`) sort by the numeric
`order`. Every `Category` carries `isDefault`; each user has exactly one `isDefault: true`
row (`No Category`) created with their profile, and every `Task.categoryId` references a
real Category row. Categories also keep an internal, transactionally-maintained `taskCount`
(not exposed in GraphQL) that the backend uses to delete a category safely.

---

## Enums

| Enum | Values |
|---|---|
| `UserRole` | `PRIMARY_USER`, `SUPPORT_PERSON`, `ORG_ADMIN` — a server-derived projection of Cognito group membership (`PrimaryUser`/`SupportPerson`/`OrganizationAdmin`); **Cognito groups are the authorization source of truth**. `SystemAdmin` is an elevated group, not a `UserRole`. |
| `AssignmentStatus` | `TO_DO`, `OVERDUE`, `COMPLETED`, `SKIPPED` — only `TO_DO`/`COMPLETED`/`SKIPPED` are persisted; `OVERDUE` is **derived** at read time (a `TO_DO` assignment whose `dueDate` is in the past) and cannot be set by a mutation |
| `MediaType` | `IMAGE`, `AUDIO`, `VIDEO` |
| `SupportLinkStatus` | `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `REVOKED` |
| `RepeatUnit` | `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH` |

### `AWSJSON` fields — encoding (foot-gun)

Free-form object fields (`accessibilitySettings`, `permissions`, `metadata`) are the
AppSync `AWSJSON` scalar. **`AWSJSON` is transported as a JSON-encoded _string_, not
a nested object.** In your `variables`, the value must be a string whose contents are
valid JSON — AppSync parses that string before the resolver sees it. Passing a nested
object instead is the most common mistake here and is rejected at the AppSync edge.

```jsonc
// ✅ correct — the value is a string containing JSON
{
  "input": {
    "displayName": "Sam",
    "accessibilitySettings": "{\"fontScale\":1.5,\"highContrast\":true}"
  }
}

// ❌ wrong — nested object; AppSync rejects this for an AWSJSON field
{
  "input": {
    "displayName": "Sam",
    "accessibilitySettings": { "fontScale": 1.5, "highContrast": true }
  }
}
```

In practice: `accessibilitySettings: JSON.stringify(settings)` on the way in. The same
applies to `permissions` (`createSupportLink`).
**Responses are symmetric** — these fields come back as JSON strings, so
`JSON.parse(profile.accessibilitySettings)` on the way out.

---

## Operations

### `healthCheck` — query

Liveness probe. Returns the static string `"OK"`. It's the one field annotated with
both `@aws_api_key` and `@aws_cognito_user_pools`, so it accepts **either** the API
key (`x-api-key`) **or** a Cognito JWT — letting monitors/CI verify connectivity
without a signed-in user. (Every other field requires a Cognito JWT.)

```graphql
query { healthCheck }
```

```bash
# With the API key (no login required):
curl -s "$GRAPHQL_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query":"query { healthCheck }"}'
```

---

### `createTask` — mutation

Creates a **reusable task template** owned by the authenticated caller, plus one
`TaskStep` item per nested step (each stored as its own row). Assigning a task to a
user is a separate operation — see `createAssignment`.

**Input — `CreateTaskInput`**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `String!` | ✅ | Non-empty after trimming |
| `categoryId` | `ID` | — | Optional; omitted/null ⇒ the owner's default category. A **blank string is rejected**. A supplied id must be a real, owned, non-deleting Category (see below) |
| `description` | `String` | — | Optional |
| `scheduleRule` | `String` | — | Optional (e.g. an RRULE) |
| `steps` | `[CreateTaskStepNestedInput!]` | — | Ordered; each becomes a `STEP#<stepId>` item; max **98**, or max **97** when `coverImageS3Key` is supplied |
| `schedule` | `TaskScheduleInput` | — | Optional recurring schedule (stored only — see below) |
| `notificationEnabled` | `Boolean` | — | Defaults to `true` when `schedule` is set; otherwise left unset unless you pass it |

> **No `ownerId`.** The owner is the caller's Cognito `sub`; a client-supplied `ownerId`
> is ignored. The owner must already have a profile (and therefore a default category) —
> call `createUserProfile` first, or `createTask` fails clearly.

`CreateTaskStepNestedInput`: `text: String!` plus optional `description: String` (trimmed;
empty/whitespace dropped). Step media is attached afterward via the upload flow, since step
ids don't exist until `createTask` returns.

**Category behavior.** Every task belongs to a **real** Category. If you omit `categoryId`
(or send `null`), the task is filed under the owner's **default category** (`No Category`,
`isDefault: true`). A **blank string** is rejected — omit the field instead. A supplied id
is validated: it must exist, belong to you, and not be mid-deletion (otherwise `NOT_FOUND`
/ `VALIDATION`). The write atomically increments the category's task count (conditioned on
the category existing and not deleting), so a concurrent `deleteCategory` can't slip a task
onto a category being removed. The returned `Task.categoryId` is always a real category id
(never `null`). Before using the default, the server strongly reads and verifies the profile
pointer and referenced Category: correct owner, exact `No Category` name, `isDefault: true`,
and no deletion in progress. A bad legacy row fails with a migration-required validation error.

**Step limit & the 100-item transaction.** A create is one DynamoDB transaction carrying
the Task, one row per step, a category condition-check, and (optionally) the cover-image
row — capped at 100 items. So a task may have at most **98** steps (97 with a cover image).

**Schedule behavior.** Pass `schedule` to attach recurring-reminder metadata. It is
**stored only** in this phase — no reminders are delivered yet (see _Not available
yet_). `TaskScheduleInput` fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repeatEvery` | `Int!` | ✅ | Must be a positive integer (e.g. `2` for "every 2 …") |
| `repeatUnit` | `RepeatUnit!` | ✅ | `MINUTE` · `HOUR` · `DAY` · `WEEK` · `MONTH` |
| `firstOccurrenceAt` | `String!` | ✅ | Non-empty ISO-8601 timestamp of the first occurrence |
| `timezone` | `String!` | ✅ | Non-empty IANA tz (e.g. `America/Toronto`) |
| `enabled` | `Boolean` | — | Defaults to `true` when stored |

When a schedule is supplied, the task is stored with `schedule` (its `enabled`
defaulted to `true`), `nextOccurrenceAt` set equal to `schedule.firstOccurrenceAt`,
and `notificationEnabled` defaulted to `true` (unless you pass `false`). Invalid
schedules are rejected before any write (e.g. `repeatEvery: 0`, or a missing
`firstOccurrenceAt`/`timezone`).

**Returns — `Task`** (with the `steps` it just created)

```graphql
mutation CreateTask($input: CreateTaskInput!) {
  createTask(input: $input) {
    taskId
    ownerId
    title
    categoryId
    createdAt
    steps { stepId order text description }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "input": {
    "title": "Wash your hands",
    "categoryId": "cat-hygiene",
    "steps": [
      { "text": "Wet your hands with warm water" },
      { "text": "Add soap and scrub for 20 seconds", "description": "Sing happy birthday twice" },
      { "text": "Rinse and dry" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The created steps are returned in `order` (`1`, `2`, `3`, …) — clients work with the
`order` field, not the internal `STEP#<stepId>` sort key.

---

### Other operations

These follow the same request/response conventions. `create…`/`update…` are
mutations; `get…`/`list…` are queries. In the **Input** columns below, required
fields are marked `!` and everything else is optional; see
[schema.graphql](../graphql/schema.graphql) for full nullability of the returned types.

> **All `list*` queries are paginated.** Each accepts optional `limit` (page size)
> and `nextToken`, and returns a `{ items, nextToken }` **connection** (e.g.
> `listTaskSteps` → `TaskStepConnection`, `listAssignmentsForUser` →
> `AssignmentConnection`). `nextToken` is an opaque, base64-encoded cursor — pass it
> back to fetch the next page; it's `null` on the last page. (See the
> `listAllUsers` example below for the paging loop — every list query works the same way.)
>
> **Index-backed lists return a partial projection.** As a general rule, any list that
> reads from a GSI returns only the fields that index projects, not the full entity —
> non-projected fields come back `null`. `listUsersByOrganization` is the canonical
> example (it populates only `userId`, `displayName`, `role`). Use these lists for
> rosters/pickers, then `get*` the full entity by id when you need the rest; don't
> assume a list item is fully hydrated.

**Users & support**

| Operation | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `createUserProfile` | `input: { displayName!, organizationId, accessibilitySettings }` (`CreateMyUserProfileInput`) | `UserProfile` — creates the **caller's own** profile **and its default category** atomically; `displayName` is required, while `userId` (Cognito `sub`), `email`, `role`, and `defaultCategoryId` are derived server-side and cannot be supplied by the client |
| `updateMyUserProfile` | `input: { displayName, accessibilitySettings }` (`UpdateMyUserProfileInput`) | `UserProfile!` — **partial** update of the **caller's own** profile; see below |
| `getUserProfile` | `userId!` | `UserProfile` · `null` if not found |
| `listUsersByOrganization` | `organizationId!, limit, nextToken` | `UserProfileConnection!` — **roster only**: just `userId`, `displayName`, `role` are populated (orgIndex projection); other fields are `null` |
| `createSupportLink` | `input: { supporterId!, primaryUserId!, status, permissions }` | `SupportLink` · `status` defaults to `PENDING` |
| `listPrimaryUsersBySupporter` | `supporterId!, limit, nextToken` | `SupportLinkConnection!` |

> **Profile bootstrap — the client must create the profile on first run.** There is
> **no automatic profile creation.** The Cognito Post Confirmation trigger does one
> thing: it adds a newly-confirmed self-registered user to the `PrimaryUser` group. It
> does **not** write a `UserProfile` row. So after a user's first sign-in, the app must
> call **`createUserProfile`** itself (a "first-run, create my profile" step) before
> `getUserProfile(mySub)` will return anything. A typical flow:
>
> 1. Sign in → obtain the ID token; decode its `sub`.
> 2. `getUserProfile(sub)` → if `null`, the profile doesn't exist yet.
> 3. `createUserProfile({ displayName, … })` → creates it at `USER#<sub>` using the
>    session identity (no id is passed; see [Identity](#identity--the-userid-field)),
>    together with the user's default `No Category` (see [Categories](#categories)).
>
> **`createUserProfile` semantics.** On the **first** call it writes the profile and its
> default category in one transaction; the profile records the generated
> `defaultCategoryId`. The profile write is **last-write-wins, not create-only** — calling
> it again **overwrites** the editable profile fields (and resets `createdAt`/`updatedAt`
> to "now"); it does **not** error on a pre-existing profile and does **not** merge. A
> re-call **preserves** the existing `defaultCategoryId` and never creates a second default
> category. So guard it behind the `getUserProfile` null-check above, or treat a second
> call as a deliberate full replace of the editable fields.
>
> **`updateMyUserProfile` semantics.** A **partial update** of the **caller's own** profile
> only — the owner is the Cognito `sub`, never a client-supplied `userId`, so a caller can
> only edit their own row. Unlike `createUserProfile`, it **never creates** a profile or a
> default category: if no profile exists it returns **NotFound** (the write is conditioned on
> the row existing). Only **`displayName`** and **`accessibilitySettings`** are editable — every
> other field (`userId`, `email`, `role`, **`organizationId`**, `defaultCategoryId`,
> `createdAt`) is left untouched and **cannot be changed through this mutation**. Supply at
> least one of the two editable fields (an empty input is rejected). Per-field rules:
>
> - **`displayName`** — omitted ⇒ unchanged; otherwise it is **trimmed**, and `null`, empty,
>   or whitespace-only values are rejected.
> - **`accessibilitySettings`** — omitted ⇒ unchanged; explicit **`null`** ⇒ the field is
>   **cleared**; a non-null value ⇒ a **full replacement** of the stored settings — it is
>   **not** deep-merged with the previous value. As elsewhere, this is an `AWSJSON` field:
>   send `JSON.stringify(settings)` and `JSON.parse` it back off the returned profile (see
>   [AWSJSON fields](#awsjson-fields--encoding-foot-gun)).
>
> The server also stamps a fresh `updatedAt`. Use this for ordinary profile edits; use
> `createUserProfile` only for first-run creation (or a deliberate full replace).
>
> **`createSupportLink` semantics.** Same shape: an unconditional put keyed on
> `(supporterId, primaryUserId)`. Re-creating the same pair **overwrites** the prior
> link — including resetting `status` back to its default `PENDING` if you omit
> `status` — rather than erroring on a duplicate. Pass `status` explicitly if you
> re-issue a link you don't want demoted.

**Categories** (all **private to the caller** — the owner is the Cognito identity, never a
client-supplied id)

| Operation | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `createCategory` | `input: { name!, color, sortOrder }` | `Category` · `name`/`color` trimmed; `categoryId` server-generated; `isDefault: false`. The reserved name `No Category` is rejected |
| `listMyCategories` | `limit, nextToken` | `CategoryConnection!` — the caller's categories (incl. their `isDefault` default) |
| `updateCategory` | `input: { categoryId!, name, color, sortOrder }` | `Category!` — partial edit; see below |
| `deleteCategory` | `input: { categoryId! }` | `Category!` — the deleted (non-default) category; reparents its tasks first; see below |

> **The default category.** Every user has exactly one default Category named
> `No Category` with `color: "#64748B"` and `isDefault: true`, created atomically with their profile
> (`createUserProfile`). Use `Category.isDefault` to identify it. A task created without an
> explicit `categoryId` is filed under it. It **cannot be renamed or deleted**; its `color`
> and `sortOrder` **can** be changed. You also cannot create or rename another category to
> `No Category`. The runtime strongly validates the profile pointer and exact canonical
> default row before using it; malformed legacy data must be repaired by the migration.
>
> **`updateCategory` is a partial edit** — supply at least one of `name`, `color`,
> `sortOrder` (a request with none is rejected). Located by `categoryId` under your own
> partition (`NOT_FOUND` if it isn't yours / doesn't exist). For a normal category, `name`
> is trimmed, must be non-empty, and may not be the reserved `No Category`. For the
> **default** category, supplying `name` at all is rejected (even if unchanged) — only
> `color`/`sortOrder` are allowed. `color`/`sortOrder` may be **cleared** with an explicit
> `null` (a `null` `name` is rejected). It is a **targeted update** that preserves internal
> state, and it **cannot** run on a category that is mid-deletion (returns a clear error).
>
> **`deleteCategory` reparents, then deletes.** The **default category cannot be deleted**.
> For a normal category, the server (1) flags it `deleting` so new tasks can't attach to (or
> move into) it, (2) moves **every** task in it to your default category — each move adjusts
> both categories' internal task counts in the same transaction — then (3) removes the
> category row **only once a strongly-consistent read proves its task count is zero**.
> Returns the deleted category.
>
> _Consistency note:_ a category may hold arbitrarily many tasks (more than one DynamoDB
> transaction can carry), so deletion runs **across multiple batches** internally and is
> **safe to retry**. Because the category index is eventually consistent, the backend does
> **not** trust an empty index query as proof there are no tasks — it tracks a durable,
> transactionally-maintained task count and deletes only when that count reaches zero. A
> failed/interrupted run (or a task the index hasn't surfaced yet) leaves the category in
> the `deleting` state and returns a **retryable** error; re-running converges and never
> leaves a task pointing at a deleted category.

**Tasks & steps**

| Operation | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `getTask` | `taskId!` | `Task` · `null` if not found · `steps` is `null` here (use `listTaskSteps`) · owner-only |
| `listTaskSteps` | `taskId!, limit, nextToken` | `TaskStepConnection!` — steps sorted by ascending `order`, order preserved across pages; owner-only; see below |
| `listTasksByOwner` | `ownerId!, limit, nextToken` | `TaskConnection!` — `ownerId` must be the caller |
| `listTasksByCategory` | `ownerId!, categoryId!, limit, nextToken` | `TaskConnection!` — tasks in one real category; **`categoryId` is required** and is validated (owned + exists + not deleting → `NOT_FOUND`/`VALIDATION`, never a silent empty result); `ownerId` must be the caller |
| `updateTask` | `input: { taskId!, title, categoryId, description, scheduleRule, schedule, notificationEnabled }` | `Task` — **partial edit**; owner-only; see below |
| `createTaskStep` | `input: { taskId!, order!, text!, description, media }` | `TaskStep` — **appends** one step at the end, optionally with initial type-specific media (owner-only); see below |
| `updateTaskStep` | `input: { taskId!, stepId!, text, description, media }` | `TaskStep` — **partial edit** of one step and its type-specific media slots; see below |
| `deleteTaskStep` | `input: { taskId!, stepId! }` | `TaskStep` — the deleted step; also deletes all its media assets; see below |
| `reorderTaskSteps` | `input: { taskId!, steps: [{ stepId!, order! }] }` | `[TaskStep!]!` — atomically renumbers all steps; see below |
| `deleteTask` | `taskId!` | `Task` — the deleted template (minus internal fields); cascades to all its steps + media; see below |

> **`updateTask` is a partial edit.** Only the fields you include change; omitted
> fields keep their current value. `ownerId` is immutable and **steps are not edited
> here** (use `createTaskStep`/`reorderTaskSteps`; per-step content editing is
> `updateTaskStep`). A missing `taskId` returns a not-found error rather than creating a
> row. Two coupled fields are kept consistent for you: changing `categoryId` recomputes the
> internal category key (so the task moves buckets in `listTasksByCategory`), and supplying
> a new `schedule` re-derives `nextOccurrenceAt`. A supplied `categoryId` must be a real
> category **you own** and not mid-deletion; moving the task decrements the old category's
> internal task count and increments the new one's **in the same transaction** (so a
> concurrent `deleteCategory` can't attach the task to a category being removed). A **blank
> string is rejected** (omit it to leave the category unchanged). `title`, if supplied,
> must be non-empty; and
> `notificationEnabled` only changes when you pass it explicitly. The `schedule` fields and
> validation are the same as [`createTask`](#createtask--mutation).
>
> ```graphql
> mutation UpdateTask($input: UpdateTaskInput!) {
>   updateTask(input: $input) { taskId title categoryId updatedAt }
> }
> ```
> ```json
> { "input": { "taskId": "task-123", "title": "Wash hands well", "categoryId": "cat-hygiene" } }
> ```

> **`updateTaskStep` is a partial edit of one step.** Identify the step by `taskId` +
> `stepId`. **Supply at least one of `text`, `description`, or a non-empty `media` list** —

**Assignments & progress tracking**

| Operation | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `createAssignment` | `input: { taskId!, userId!, assignedBy, dueDate, recurrence, scheduleRule }` | `Assignment` · always created with persisted status `TO_DO`. Validates the `Task` exists, then snapshots its `TaskStep`s into one `AssignmentStep` per step (all `completed: false`), atomically. Errors if the task is missing or has > 99 steps (DynamoDB's 100-item transaction limit). |
| `updateAssignmentStatus` | `input: { userId!, assignmentId!, status! }` | `Assignment` · `status` accepts only `TO_DO`/`COMPLETED`/`SKIPPED` (`OVERDUE` is rejected). **Needs both `userId` and `assignmentId`** (they form the item key); errors if the assignment doesn't exist. Setting `COMPLETED` is rejected while any `AssignmentStep` is still incomplete (a zero-step assignment may be completed). Marking all steps complete does **not** auto-complete the assignment — the client sets `COMPLETED` explicitly. |
| `setAssignmentStepCompletion` | `input: { userId!, assignmentId!, stepId!, completed! }` | `AssignmentStep` · toggles one step. Sets `completedAt` to now when `completed: true`, clears it when `false`. Rejected if the assignment is `COMPLETED` or `SKIPPED`; 404s if the assignment or step doesn't exist for the user. |
| `deleteAssignment` | `input: { userId!, assignmentId! }` | `Assignment` · the deleted assignment (internal fields stripped); deletes all its `AssignmentStep`s. See below. |
| `listAssignmentsForUser` | `userId!, limit, nextToken` | `AssignmentConnection!` · `status` is returned with `OVERDUE` derived and legacy values mapped (see [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-progress--assignment-rework)). |
| `listAssignmentSteps` | `userId!, assignmentId!, limit, nextToken` | `AssignmentStepConnection!` · one assignment's step snapshots, sorted by `order`. |

> **`deleteAssignment` removes an assignment and all its steps.** Identify it by `userId`
> + `assignmentId` (its composite key). Deletes the `Assignment` row **and every
> `AssignmentStep` snapshot** under it, then returns the deleted `Assignment` (internal
> storage fields stripped; `status` is derived/legacy-mapped as on reads). A missing

> (its completion can be toggled with `setAssignmentStepCompletion`, nothing more).
>
> _Consistency note:_ identical to `deleteTask` — an assignment with **>99 step
> snapshots** can't be deleted in one atomic transaction (DynamoDB's 100-item limit), so
> steps are batch-deleted first and the assignment row last, making the call idempotent/

**Media**

| Operation | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `createMediaUploadUrl` | `input: { taskId!, contentType!, fileName }` | `MediaUploadTarget` — see flow below |
| `createTaskCoverImageUploadUrl` | `input: { contentType!, fileName }` | `MediaUploadTarget!` — temporary cover-image upload; see [cover images](#task-cover-images) |
| `createMediaAsset` | `input: { taskId!, s3Key!, type!, mimeType!, ownerId!, size }` | `MediaAsset` — initially unattached; see flow below |
| `deleteMediaAsset` | `input: { taskId!, assetId! }` | `MediaAsset` — deletes the binary + row + dangling refs; see below |
| `getMediaDownloadUrl` | `taskId!, assetId!` | `MediaDownloadTarget` — see flow below |
| `listMediaForTask` | `taskId!, limit, nextToken` | `MediaAssetConnection!` |

> **Media is upload-first.** Binaries live in the S3 media bucket; DynamoDB stores
> only the `s3Key` and metadata (`type`, `mimeType`, `ownerId`, `size`). Newly created
> media is initially unattached. Clients never need AWS credentials — they upload through
> a presigned URL:
>
> 1. **`createMediaUploadUrl({ taskId, contentType, fileName? })`** → returns
>    `{ uploadUrl, s3Key, expiresIn }`. `uploadUrl` is a short-lived (default 15 min)
>    presigned **PUT**; `s3Key` is server-chosen (`media/<taskId>/<uuid>.<ext>`).
> 2. **`PUT` the raw file bytes to `uploadUrl`** with the same `Content-Type` you
>    passed as `contentType` (direct browser/mobile upload to S3 — the bucket allows
>    CORS PUT). No GraphQL, no credentials.
> 3. **`createMediaAsset({ taskId, s3Key, type, mimeType, ownerId, size? })`**
>    → registers the now-uploaded object's metadata. Attach it in a standalone
>    `createTaskStep({ media: [{ type, assetId }] })` or later with
>    `updateTaskStep({ media: [{ type, assetId }] })`.
>
> ```bash
> # 2) upload the bytes to the presigned URL from step 1
> curl -X PUT "$UPLOAD_URL" -H "Content-Type: image/png" --data-binary @photo.png
> ```
>
> **Viewing/downloading is symmetric.** The bucket is private, so to render media
> call **`getMediaDownloadUrl(taskId, assetId)`** → `{ downloadUrl, s3Key, expiresIn }`
> and `GET` the (short-lived) `downloadUrl`. It only signs assets that are actually
> registered — unknown ids return a not-found error rather than signing an arbitrary key.

> **`deleteMediaAsset({ taskId, assetId })`** permanently removes one media asset: its
> **S3 binary** and its **DynamoDB row**, after first clearing every API-visible
> reference to it — if it was the task's cover image, `Task.coverImageAssetId` is
> cleared; if it belongs to a step, it no longer appears in that step's derived
> `mediaAssets` list. The `Task` and its `TaskSteps` are **not** deleted. Returns the deleted asset (internal storage
> fields stripped); a missing asset returns a not-found error.
>
> _Consistency & sharing:_ DynamoDB and S3 aren't transactional, so references and the
> metadata row are deleted **first**, then the S3 object — the API never points at a
> file that's gone. The call is **idempotent/retryable** (a re-run returns not-found;
> S3 delete is a no-op for an already-absent object). If the S3 delete fails after the
> row is gone, the failure is **logged with `taskId`/`assetId`/`s3Key`** for a
> retry/cleanup job (never silently ignored) and leaves only an orphaned binary, not a
> dangling reference. **Each media asset belongs to exactly one `Task`** (it lives under
> `TASK#<taskId>`) and is deleted with it — assets are not shared across tasks.

---

### Task cover images

A `Task` may have **one optional cover image** (`Task.coverImageAssetId`, nullable). The
file is an ordinary private-S3 object recorded as a `MediaAsset` (`type: IMAGE`, no
`stepId`). Binary bytes never travel through GraphQL — the existing presigned-PUT flow is
used, with a temporary key so it also works at **create** time (before a `taskId` exists).

**Sequence (create or update):**

1. **`createTaskCoverImageUploadUrl({ contentType, fileName? })`** → `{ uploadUrl, s3Key,
   expiresIn }`. `contentType` must be `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, or `image/webp` (others
   are rejected). `s3Key` is a server-owned **pending** key
   (`media/pending/task-cover/<uuid>.<ext>`).
2. **`PUT` the image bytes to `uploadUrl`** with that same `Content-Type` (direct to S3).
3. Pass the pending `s3Key` as **`coverImageS3Key`** to **`createTask`** or
   **`updateTask`**. The server then, server-side:
   - rejects any key not under the pending prefix (no arbitrary keys);
   - **`HeadObject`** verifies the *real* object — it must exist, be an allowed image
     type, and be `0 < size ≤ 10 MB` (client-declared MIME/size are never trusted);
   - copies it to a task-owned key (`media/<taskId>/<assetId>.<ext>`), deletes the temp
     object, registers the `MediaAsset`, and sets `Task.coverImageAssetId`.
4. **To display it:** call **`getMediaDownloadUrl(taskId, coverImageAssetId)`** — there is
   no cover URL exposed directly on `Task`.

```graphql
mutation CoverUrl($input: CreateTaskCoverImageUploadUrlInput!) {
  createTaskCoverImageUploadUrl(input: $input) { uploadUrl s3Key expiresIn }
}
# then: PUT bytes to uploadUrl, then createTask/updateTask with coverImageS3Key: <s3Key>
```

- **On `createTask`:** the cover `MediaAsset` row is written **in the same transaction**
  as the `Task` + `TaskStep`s. If that write fails after the S3 copy, the copied object is
  best-effort deleted and the original error is preserved.
- **On `updateTask`:** supplying `coverImageS3Key` **replaces** the cover. The new asset
  is verified, copied, and persisted (Task + new `MediaAsset`) atomically **first**; only
  then is the **old** cover's row + S3 object removed (best-effort). Omitting
  `coverImageS3Key` leaves the current cover unchanged. A new cover is never rolled back if
  old-cover cleanup fails — that failure is logged (`taskId`, old `assetId`, `s3Key`) for
  retry.
- Abandoned pending uploads (`media/pending/task-cover/`) are expired by an **S3 lifecycle
  rule after 24h**.

### Admin listings — queries (SystemAdmin only)

`list-all-by-entity-type` endpoints for admin/debug tooling. They query the
`entityTypeIndex` (never a Scan), return newest-first, and are **restricted to the
`SystemAdmin` Cognito group** — both at the AppSync edge (`@aws_cognito_user_pools`)
and re-checked in the resolver. A non-SystemAdmin caller gets an authorization error.

| Operation | Returns |
|---|---|
| `listAllUsers(limit, nextToken)` | `UserProfileConnection` |
| `listAllTasks(limit, nextToken)` | `TaskConnection` |

Both take an optional `limit` (page size) and `nextToken`, and return
`{ items, nextToken }`. `nextToken` is an **opaque, base64-encoded** cursor — pass
the value you got back to fetch the next page; it's `null` on the last page.

```graphql
query ListUsers($limit: Int, $nextToken: String) {
  listAllUsers(limit: $limit, nextToken: $nextToken) {
    items { userId role displayName organizationId createdAt }
    nextToken
  }
}
```

```ts
// Page through every user (requires a SystemAdmin JWT in Authorization):
let nextToken: string | undefined;
do {
  const page = await graphql(LIST_USERS, { limit: 50, nextToken }, systemAdminToken);
  process(page.listAllUsers.items);
  nextToken = page.listAllUsers.nextToken ?? undefined;
} while (nextToken);
```

`listAllTasks` returns Task `#META` items only (TaskStep items have
`entityType = "TaskStep"`, so they don't appear here).

---

### Admin mutations (SystemAdmin only)

Cognito role management + destructive data cleanup, in the same `canplan-admin-<env>`
Lambda. Every mutation is **restricted to the `SystemAdmin` group** — both at the AppSync
edge (`@aws_cognito_user_pools(cognito_groups: ["SystemAdmin"])`) and re-checked in the
resolver. **Cognito group membership remains the authorization source of truth**; these
APIs manage that membership and the data behind it.

The `userId` in every input is the **app-level id = the Cognito `sub`**. The resolver maps
it to the Cognito `Username` with a `ListUsers` `sub = "…"` filter (Cognito's Admin\* APIs
need the `Username`, which is not the `sub` for an email-alias pool).

> **Bootstrap:** there is no API to mint the first SystemAdmin — add the first admin to the
> `SystemAdmin` Cognito group manually (console, or `aws cognito-idp admin-add-user-to-group`).
> Admins log in through the **same** Cognito app client as everyone else.
>
> **Group changes propagate via new JWTs:** Cognito groups are embedded in the issued token,
> so a user must **refresh their tokens or re-login** after an invite / `setUserBaseRole` /
> `setSystemAdmin` before the change takes effect.

| Operation | Returns | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `inviteSupportPerson(input: InviteUserInput!)` | `AdminUserResult!` | `AdminCreateUser` (or adopt an existing user on `UsernameExistsException`) + add **only** `SupportPerson`. Never adds `PrimaryUser`. No `UserProfile` is created. |
| `inviteOrganizationAdmin(input: InviteUserInput!)` | `AdminUserResult!` | Same, adding **only** `OrganizationAdmin`. |
| `setUserBaseRole(input: SetUserBaseRoleInput!)` | `AdminUserResult!` | Remove all base groups, add the one target (`PRIMARY_USER`/`SUPPORT_PERSON`/`ORG_ADMIN`). Mirror onto an existing `UserProfile.role` (never creates one). `SystemAdmin` untouched. |
| `setSystemAdmin(input: SetSystemAdminInput!)` | `AdminUserResult!` | `enabled:true` grants / `false` revokes the `SystemAdmin` group (base roles untouched). **Self-demotion rejected.** |
| `adminDeleteTask(taskId: ID!)` | `Task` | Delete **any** task regardless of owner — same cascade as the owner `deleteTask` (steps, media rows + S3 binaries, category `taskCount`). Returns the deleted task, or `null` if already gone. |
| `adminDeleteUser(input: AdminDeleteUserInput!)` | `AdminDeleteUserResult!` | Full user deletion (see below). **Self-deletion rejected.** |

**Inputs**

- `InviteUserInput`: `email: AWSEmail!`, `displayName: String`, `organizationId: ID`
  (reserved; not persisted yet).
- `SetUserBaseRoleInput`: `userId: ID!`, `role: AdminBaseRole!` (`PRIMARY_USER` /
  `SUPPORT_PERSON` / `ORG_ADMIN`).
- `SetSystemAdminInput`: `userId: ID!`, `enabled: Boolean!`.
- `AdminDeleteUserInput`: `userId: ID!`, `deleteCognitoUser: Boolean = true`,
  `disableFirst: Boolean = true`.

`AdminUserResult` is `{ userId, email, groups: [String!]!, profile: UserProfile }` — the
user's `sub`, email, **current** Cognito groups, and their profile if one exists (`null`
otherwise — invites don't create a profile).

**`adminDeleteUser` order (retryable; no Scan):**

1. If `deleteCognitoUser` and `disableFirst`, `AdminDisableUser` first (so an in-flight
   session can't race the cleanup).
2. Delete every **owned task** via `taskOwnerIndex` → the shared cascade each.
3. Delete every row in the **`USER#<userId>` partition** (profile, categories, assignments,
   assignment steps, progress events, …) with one PK query + batch delete.
4. Delete every `SupportLink` where the user is the **supporter** (`SUPPORTER#<userId>`
   partition) **and** where they are the **primary user** (`primaryUserSupportLinkIndex`).
5. **Last**, if `deleteCognitoUser`, `AdminDeleteUser`. Any DynamoDB/S3 failure above throws
   before this step, so the login is never removed while data remains; an already-missing
   user counts as success once data cleanup completes.

Returns `AdminDeleteUserResult { userId, deletedTasks, deletedUserItems, deletedSupportLinks,
deletedCognitoUser }`.

```graphql
mutation InviteSupport($input: InviteUserInput!) {
  inviteSupportPerson(input: $input) { userId email groups profile { displayName role } }
}

mutation PromoteToAdmin($input: SetSystemAdminInput!) {
  setSystemAdmin(input: $input) { userId groups }   # userId = the target user's Cognito sub
}

mutation DeleteUser($input: AdminDeleteUserInput!) {
  adminDeleteUser(input: $input) {
    userId deletedTasks deletedUserItems deletedSupportLinks deletedCognitoUser
  }
}
```

### `generateTaskSteps` — mutation

Breaks a daily-living task into ordered, **source-cited** steps via the Bedrock
Knowledge Base + RAG. Unchanged from before.

**Input — `GenerateTaskStepsInput`**: `userId: String!`, `query: String!`,
`context: { role, organizationId }`.

**Returns — `TaskStepsResponse`**: `steps: [GeneratedStep!]!` (each
`{ text, citations { chunkId, title, url, snippet } }`), plus `model`, `inputTokens`,
`outputTokens`.

> Note: the AI-generated `GeneratedStep` (carries citations) is distinct from the
> persisted `TaskStep` entity (carries storage metadata). They are different types.

---

### `createAiTask` — mutation

Generates a clean **title + ordered steps** for one free-text request over the same
Bedrock Knowledge Base + RAG, and returns them directly as a **preview**. It **persists
nothing** — no `Task`, `TaskStep`, category count, or `MediaAsset` is written, and no
`categoryId` is resolved. The caller decides whether to keep the result and saves it
later via [`createTask`](#createtask--mutation). Citations are intentionally dropped
(end users have cognitive disabilities). Owner is derived from the Cognito identity.

**Input — `CreateAiTaskInput`**: `query: String!` (the free-text request; empty/whitespace
is rejected with `VALIDATION`). `categoryId` is accepted by the input type but **ignored**
— nothing is saved, so no category is resolved.

**Returns — `GeneratedAiTask!`**: `title: String!`, `steps: [GeneratedAiTaskStep!]!`
(each `{ text }` — **text only**, no step ids and no citations), plus `inputTokens`,
`outputTokens`. No database-created fields (`taskId`, `ownerId`, `categoryId`,
`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are returned.

> A generation failure (e.g. no relevant KB guidance) throws before anything is
> returned and nothing is ever written. Because it persists nothing, the result is a
> throwaway preview: re-running the same `query` may yield different wording.

```graphql
mutation CreateAiTask($input: CreateAiTaskInput!) {
  createAiTask(input: $input) {
    title
    steps { text }
    inputTokens
    outputTokens
  }
}
```

## Error handling

GraphQL does **not** use HTTP status codes for field-level problems. A request that
reached a resolver returns **HTTP 200** with the failure in an `errors` array;
`data` for the failed field is `null`. Always check `errors` before reading `data`.

Each entry in `errors` carries a `message` (prose, human-readable) and an `errorType`
(a code). **Branch on `errorType`, not on `message`** — message strings are not a
stable contract and may be reworded at any time.

### `errorType` codes

| `errorType` | HTTP | Meaning | Client should |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UnauthorizedException` | 401 | Missing/invalid/expired token at the AppSync edge — never reached a resolver | Re-authenticate (refresh the Cognito session) |
| `NOT_AUTHORIZED` | 200 | Authenticated, but not allowed to act on this id/resource | Handle as a normal denial — **see caveat below** |
| `VALIDATION` | 200 | Bad input (missing/empty required field, invalid schedule, etc.) | Fix the input; surface to the user |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 200 | The referenced id doesn't exist (e.g. `updateTask` on an unknown `taskId`, signing a download URL for an unregistered asset) | Treat as "gone"; distinct from a successful `null` on `get*` |
| `INTERNAL` | 200 | Resolver failure (Bedrock/KB error, downstream AWS error, unexpected bug) | Retry/backoff; report if persistent |
| (parse/validation) | 200/400 | Malformed query or unknown field — a client bug, not runtime data | Fix the query |

> ⚠️ **Stability caveat — current vs. intended.** The codes above are the **intended,
> stable contract**; build your client to branch on them. But in **this phase**, only
> the edge-level `UnauthorizedException` is emitted as shown. Resolver-level failures
> (validation, not-found, internal) are currently surfaced by AppSync as
> **`errorType: "Lambda:Unhandled"`**, with the specific cause only in `message`. The
> server already distinguishes these cases internally (`ValidationError` /
> `NotFoundError` / `UnauthorizedError`); wiring them through to the codes above is
> tracked under [Not available yet](#not-available-yet). Until then, if you must
> branch today, do so defensively (e.g. fall back to matching `message`) and migrate
> to `errorType` once the codes land. `NOT_AUTHORIZED` in particular does **not** fire
> yet — see the authorization warning at the top.

---

## Not available yet

Planned but not implemented — don't build against them:

- **Push notifications / reminder delivery** — `createTask` and `updateTask` accept
  and persist `schedule` metadata (and derive `nextOccurrenceAt` /
  `notificationEnabled`), but **nothing fires reminders yet**. There is no scheduling
  engine (EventBridge), no device-token registration, and no push-notification Lambda
  in this phase — only the query-ready fields are stored.
- **Per-role/owner authorization on domain operations** — the `SystemAdmin` admin
  queries are group-gated (enforced), and `createUserProfile` is self-scoped (it
  derives `userId`/`email`/`role` from the caller's Cognito session). The other
  create/get/list resolvers don't yet verify the caller (e.g. that a primary user
  only reads their own data, or that a supporter owns the task). The schema and
  single-table keys are structured to support these rules. **See the authorization
  warning at the top of this doc** — when these land, currently-succeeding calls on
  someone else's id will start returning a `NOT_AUTHORIZED` error.
- **Stable resolver `errorType` codes** — `VALIDATION` / `NOT_FOUND` / `NOT_AUTHORIZED`
  / `INTERNAL` (see [Error handling](#error-handling)) are the intended contract, but
  resolver errors currently surface as `Lambda:Unhandled` with the cause only in
  `message`. Branch defensively until the codes are wired through.
- **Delete** exists for categories (`deleteCategory`, non-default only), tasks
  (`deleteTask`), task steps (`deleteTaskStep`), assignments (`deleteAssignment`), and media
  assets (`deleteMediaAsset`); there is **no standalone delete for an `AssignmentStep`** (it
  is removed only when its parent `Assignment` is deleted). **Update** exists for categories
  (`updateCategory`), tasks (`updateTask`), task steps (`updateTaskStep`), task-step ordering
  (`reorderTaskSteps`), and assignment status (`updateAssignmentStatus`); other entities have
  no update yet.
- **Report generation** — the `Report` type exists in the schema, but no query or
  mutation is exposed for it yet.
- **Streaming AI responses** — `generateTaskSteps` is request/response only.

## Breaking changes: categories & tasks rework

Categories became first-class and private; Task status was removed; TaskStep storage and
ordering changed. **This is a breaking API change.**

**Removed**

- `TaskStatus` enum and `Task.status` (output), plus `status` on `CreateTaskInput` /
  `UpdateTaskInput`. Tasks have no status.
- `ownerId` on `CreateTaskInput` and `CreateCategoryInput` — both are derived from the
  caller's Cognito identity.
- `listCategoriesByOwner(ownerId, …)` — replaced by `listMyCategories(…)`.

**Changed**

- `listTasksByCategory` now **requires** a real `categoryId` (no implicit "uncategorized"
  bucket).
- `TaskStep` storage moved from order-based sort keys (`STEP#001`) to stable
  `STEP#<stepId>` keys; `order` is a plain attribute. List/read paths sort by `order`.
- **Task & TaskStep operations are now owner-scoped** (caller `sub` must equal the task's
  `ownerId`); `createTaskStep` is **append-only** (next position; max 99 steps).

**Added**

- A real **default category** per user (`No Category`, `isDefault: true`) created
  atomically with the profile; `UserProfile.defaultCategoryId` and `Category.isDefault`.
- Category management: `createCategory` (no `ownerId`), `listMyCategories`,
  `updateCategory`, `deleteCategory` (default-category immutability + reparent-on-delete).
- An **internal `Category.taskCount`** (not exposed in GraphQL) — a durable, transactionally
  maintained count of the tasks in each category, so `deleteCategory` is safe despite the
  eventually-consistent category index.
- `TaskStep.description` (optional), persisted by create/update; AssignmentStep snapshots
  are unchanged (no `description`).
- `reorderTaskSteps` — atomic whole-task reordering.

**Data compatibility / migration**

- A documented, **idempotent, dry-run-by-default** migration
  (`scripts/migrate-default-categories.ts`) that: ensures **exactly one valid default
  category** per profile (creating one when missing, **repairing** a missing/invalid
  `defaultCategoryId` pointer, deterministically keeping the lowest canonical default id,
  and demoting duplicate/legacy default flags to `Recovered Category <short-id>`); reparents
  legacy `NO_CATEGORY`/dangling tasks to the owner's default;
  strips legacy Task `status`; **backfills `Category.taskCount`** to the true number of tasks
  in each category; backfills Task step append metadata (`stepCount`, `stepVersion`,
  `nextStepOrder`); and rekeys legacy order-based `TaskStep` rows to `STEP#<stepId>`. Old
  `STEP#` rows stay readable during the rollout (the prefix is unchanged; reads sort by
  `order`), so it runs as a maintenance migration after deploy. **Run it before relying on
  `deleteCategory` against legacy data** (which needs `taskCount`). See the README "Data
  Migration" section for the runbook.

## Breaking changes: progress & assignment rework

The `ProgressEvent`-based progress model was replaced by assignment-level status plus
per-assignment step completion. **This is a breaking API change.**

**Removed**

- `ProgressEvent` type, `ProgressEventType` enum, `ProgressEventConnection`,
  `CreateProgressEventInput`, the `createProgressEvent` mutation, and the
  `listProgressEventsForUser` query. The `canplan-progress-<env>` Lambda and its
  resolver wiring are gone.
- `Assignment.active` and the `active` input on `createAssignment` /
  `updateAssignmentStatus`.
- The `status` input on `createAssignment` — assignments are always created `TO_DO`.

**Changed — `AssignmentStatus`**

- New values: `TO_DO`, `OVERDUE`, `COMPLETED`, `SKIPPED`.
- Only `TO_DO`, `COMPLETED`, and `SKIPPED` are ever persisted. `OVERDUE` is **derived**
  at read time — an assignment is `OVERDUE` when its persisted status is `TO_DO`, it has
  a `dueDate`, and that `dueDate` is in the past. An assignment without a `dueDate` is
  never `OVERDUE`. Mutations reject an attempt to set `OVERDUE`.

**Added — per-assignment steps**

- `AssignmentStep` is an immutable snapshot of one `TaskStep` captured into one
  `Assignment` at creation (`assignmentId`, `taskId`, `stepId`, `order`, `text`,
  `completed`, `completedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
  Editing the `Task` template later does **not** change historical assignments.
- `listAssignmentSteps(userId, assignmentId, …)` and
  `setAssignmentStepCompletion(input)` (see the operations table above).

**Data compatibility**

- Existing `Assignment` rows with legacy statuses are mapped on read so the new enum
  never surfaces an invalid value: `ACTIVE` → `TO_DO`, `PAUSED` → `TO_DO`,
  `CANCELLED` → `SKIPPED`, `COMPLETED` → `COMPLETED`. A legacy `active` attribute is
  dropped from responses.
- Legacy assignments created before this change have **no** `AssignmentStep` rows, so
  `listAssignmentSteps` returns empty for them. Only assignments created via the new
  `createAssignment` carry step snapshots.
- This is an API/code refactor only: existing `ProgressEvent` rows are **left in
  DynamoDB** (not deleted) — they are simply no longer served by any API.
